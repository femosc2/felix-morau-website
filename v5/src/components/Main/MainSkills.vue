              I wrote my first lines of code in early 2017 when I started learning Web Development through HTML and CSS.
              I enrolled in the Information Architecture Programme at Malm√∂ University in the fall of 2017 and started learning programming through Python.
              Programming became my primary hobby ever since I wrote my first "Hello World!" and I'm always exploring new concepts, languages or designs.
              At the moment I am primarily using React, Vue and Node as I have interest in both Front-end and Back-end programming.

              <br>
              <span class="hiddenOnResponsive">While programming is what I specialize in I also learn a lot of UX-design through university.
              Im well versed in proper UX-design including Information Architecture, Interaction Design and Information Design.
              I also have a minor interest in graphic design having used Photoshop for creating posters and logos for various projects.
